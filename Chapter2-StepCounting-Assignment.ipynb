The acceleration changes as a result of the step can result in changes along all the three axes, so we need to design an orientation-independent algorithm. The easiest way to do this is to use the magnitude of the signal across all the three axes."

It is important to carefully consider such changes since the threshold values could change depending on the current activity.\n",
